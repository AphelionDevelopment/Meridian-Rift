# Native artifact contract

`dogmos.lock.json` is the game-side authority for one paired release. It identifies schema, ABI and protocol version, Rust crate/source/toolchain/byondapi revisions, sorted features/fingerprint, generated bindings digest, and platform artifact names/hashes.

Required release members are:

- Windows 32-bit shim `dogmos.dll` and 64-bit service `dogmosd.exe`, with symbols;
- Linux 32-bit shim `libdogmos.so` and 64-bit service `dogmosd`, with symbols;
- generated `code/__DEFINES/dogmos_bindings.dm`;
- generated `code/__DEFINES/dogmos_contract.dm` from the verified manifest.

The game validates ABI, protocol version, exact source revision, feature fingerprint, bindings digest, shim hash, and service hash before gas registration. The runtime handshake independently requires shim/service agreement. Missing, truncated, wrong-architecture, cross-revision, development, or hash-mismatched inputs reject the complete set; never load a partial pair.

Generated bindings/contract defines are never hand-edited. A maintained synchronizer verifies a scratch staging directory and installs the complete platform set atomically. Production Docker/TGS paths fetch an exact revision or verified release, never a mutable branch.

Native artifacts, lockfiles, generators/synchronizers, Docker, TGS, release workflows, and dependency authority are protected infrastructure. Name exact files/effects and obtain explicit user approval before changing them.
