# Dogmos module agent instructions

Read the repository-root `AGENTS.md` and every Dogmos guide linked from `docs/agent/README.md` before
changing this module, its fork-owned atmosphere implementation, generated bindings, or native
artifacts. The gameplay-event boundary is specified in `docs/agent/dogmos-gameplay-events.md`.

Use Meridian-MCP after `dm_parse_environment` for DreamMaker discovery and inspection. Use PowerShell
for builds, tests, DreamDaemon, Rust, and process measurement. Reparse after DM source changes.

Optimize only DreamDaemon memory as a footprint goal. Keep service-owned state and event history in
64-bit `dogmosd`; the 32-bit shim stays fixed and bounded. Do not retain DM refs in Rust, introduce a
generic remote proc call, silently drop gameplay events, or add a persistent DM-side event queue.

Preserve public DM behavior and event order. Changes to event payloads, handle generations, queue
capacity, lifecycle recovery, or generated artifacts require the verification gates in the linked
guides. Leave changes uncommitted unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
