/**
 * Dogmos Kennel Phase 3: kennel_profile_reactions gates real Rust-side timing around every
 * react_by_id() call (react_hook, aphelion-dogmos src/lib.rs) - reads the toggle fresh, same
 * "no rebuild needed to flip live" pattern as realistic_space_radiation/blackbody_enabled. Runs a real
 * plasmafire reaction (same seed as dogmos_aphelion_reactions.dm) against a real turf holder, with the
 * threshold set to 0 so any nonzero call duration trips it, and checks the recorded entry's fields -
 * not just that SOMETHING was recorded.
 *
 * Covers the toggle itself directly: profiling OFF must record nothing, even with an identical reaction
 * and a threshold of 0 - the record path only exists because profiling turned it on.
