/**
 * A plain station floor must actually hold a standard atmosphere.

 * This is the end-to-end catch for an init-order regression, and it survives being run well after
 * init specifically because of how the damage is cached, not despite it:
 * SSair.parse_gas_string() (code\controllers\subsystem\air.dm) inserts the newly-constructed
 * canonical mixture into SSair.strings_to_mix BEFORE populating it with gas. If the gas registry
 * wasn't live yet when the first turf was built, every set_moles() call on that mixture is silently
 * rejected by Dogmos, and the now-permanently-empty canonical mix is what every later turf (and every
 * restore_atmos() call) copies for the rest of the round - registration completing afterwards does
 * not repair the cache. Temperature is set separately and is unaffected, so the failure signature is
 * specifically "room temperature, zero moles, zero pressure", not a cold vacuum.
