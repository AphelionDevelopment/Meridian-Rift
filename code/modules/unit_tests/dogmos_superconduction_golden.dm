/**
 * The real correctness check for the SSAIR_SUPERCONDUCTIVITY cutover to Rust's turf-to-turf heat
 * conduction (process_turf_heat, aphelion-dogmos src/turfs/superconduct.rs, driven from
 * SSair.process_super_conductivity(), code/controllers/subsystem/air.dm). Checks the same class of
 * physical invariant dogmos_gas_fdm_golden.dm checks for gas diffusion: heat flows hot -> cold, and
 * conduction doesn't overshoot into reversing which turf is hotter.
 *
 * Setting blocks_air on turf_b is the whole point of the setup, not incidental. Superconduction moves
 * heat where gas CANNOT flow, so two gas-adjacent turfs deliberately get no heat edge at all:
 * /turf/open/conductivity_directions() returns only directions whose neighbor is absent from
 * atmos_adjacent_turfs, and sync_dogmos_adjacency() (LINDA_system.dm) then stores the INVERSE of that
 * as conductivity_blocked_directions, which is what Rust builds its heat graph from
 * (ALL_CARDINALS_MULTIZ - blocked_dirs). A plain adjacent pair - which is exactly what
 * allocate_turf_pair() guarantees, since it asserts gas-adjacency - therefore can never conduct, and an
 * earlier version of this test that used one failed for precisely that reason. Marking turf_b
 * blocks_air breaks gas adjacency, which is what CREATES the heat edge:
 * * immediate_calculate_adjacent_turfs() drops turf_b from turf_a's atmos_adjacent_turfs (its
 *   `!(blocks_air || current_turf.blocks_air)` branch), so that direction becomes non-gas-adjacent and
 *   is left out of turf_a's conductivity_blocked_directions.
 * * turf_b, being blocks_air, takes /turf/open/conductivity_directions()'s `return ..()` branch to the
 *   base /turf version (ALL_CARDINALS), so nothing is blocked for it and the reverse edge exists too.
 * * Both keep init_air = TRUE and so both still register - closed turfs would NOT, since /turf/closed
 *   sets init_air = FALSE and register_dogmos_air() early-returns on that, which is why this can't
 *   simply test against a real wall.
 * This mirrors dogmos_turf_registration.dm's own blocks_air case, which exists to prove heat-only
 * registration works.
 *
 * The live SSair owns frontier publication and resumable stage ordering. The test therefore activates
 * the hot turf and observes bounded live subsystem cycles instead of calling a stage proc directly.
