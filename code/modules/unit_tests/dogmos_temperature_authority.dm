/**
 * Verifies that blocked turfs can select their live temperature authority without allowing an

 *
 * Open turfs keep their gas-mixture temperature contract. This test deliberately uses an open turf
 * whose `blocks_air` flag makes it a heat-only Dogmos registration, which is the disputed case from
 * the branch review: Rust's heat graph can move while the legacy DM turf var remains unchanged.
