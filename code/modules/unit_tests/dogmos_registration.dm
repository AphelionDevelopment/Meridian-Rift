/**
 * Verifies that every gas and reaction was handed to Dogmos during SSair init.
 *
 * Test suite streamlining pass (2026-08-15): this file used to also hold a separate `dogmos_load` test
 * (the Phase 0 gate - proving the library resolves and a bare call_ext round-trip works). Phase 0 is now
 * solidly proven: `boot_probe.ps1` already independently verifies the game boots with 0 runtime errors
 * before the suite even runs (which cannot happen if the library failed to load), and every assertion
 * below requires a working, answering FFI just to reach SSdogmos.gases_registered - a load failure would
 * fail loudly and immediately right here, not silently. `dogmos_load`'s own value had become fully
 * subsumed; removed rather than kept as a second, narrower copy of the same "does Dogmos answer" proof.
 * Its one cheap, genuinely-standalone check (does __detect_dogmos() resolve a library name at all) is
 * kept below as this test's first line, since a load failure landing on line 1 with a distinct message
 * is worth the one-liner.
