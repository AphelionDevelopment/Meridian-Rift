/**
 * Dogmos Kennel Phase 4: kennel_mark_overlay_recent() keeps at most KENNEL_OVERLAY_RECENT_CAP distinct
 * turfs lit per event-based overlay category, evicting the oldest (by vis_contents, the actual visible
 * effect - not just an internal counter) once the cap is exceeded. Also covers that re-marking an
 * already-tracked turf moves it to the front instead of creating a duplicate tracker entry - which
 * would otherwise let a single hot location silently eat the whole cap on itself.
