/**
 * Dogmos Kennel: check_kennel_reaction_of_interest() reads air.reaction_results, which per
 * turf_settled()'s own doc comment (air.dm) is cumulative and never cleared - an entry's key survives
 * forever once a reaction has fired there once. Without T.kennel_last_reaction_results as a
 * last-seen-value cache, a turf that reacted once above threshold would be re-recorded into
 * recent_reactions_of_interest every single time this walk revisits it, even if nothing new happened.
 * Covers three cases directly: below threshold (never recorded), above threshold the first time
 * (recorded once), and an unchanged value on a later call (NOT re-recorded).
