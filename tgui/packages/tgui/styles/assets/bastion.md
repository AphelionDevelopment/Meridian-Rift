# Bastion casing assets

These assets implement the approved second Bastion mockup, with rusted olive
metal surrounding cream-on-dark reading surfaces.

The generation prompt requested a flat, evenly lit dark olive steel material
with irregular muted iron-rust patches, pitting, granular paint wear, and fine
scratches. It excluded text, logos, UI, objects, borders, panel divisions, bolts,
perspective, and directional lighting. Opposing edges were requested to match
for repeated use; the delivered image is 1254 by 1254 pixels. The separate SVG
supplies the plate geometry and fasteners without baking interface details into
the raster material. Neither file contains extracted franchise artwork.

`bastion-rust.jpg` is 334,019 bytes. Its SHA-256 is
`a90d436919b9198561bbe16f2ba33aa63c7f2c8ef14d8dcc7c0e16316fb8ec86`.
Rspack inlines the JPEG and SVG into both the TGUI and lobby stylesheets, so
BYOND's cached CSS contains the material without separate texture requests.
